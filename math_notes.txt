area of radius graph, cheating with linear in 1/r radius change over time

A = Ar + At

Ar = area of "rectangle" formed by first position's radius. r1 * t
At = area of triangle formed by change in radius to r2. (r2 - r1) / 2 * t

Therefore
A = (((r2 - r1) / 2) + r1) * t
2A = ((r2 - r1) + 2r1) * t
2A = (r2 + r1) * t
A = (r2 + r1) * 0.5 * t

if we fix a value for t we can bake the 0.5 into that, becoming:
let c = 0.5 * t
A = (r2 + r1) * c

(remember r values being 1/r here)
